# Welcome To CSVs and PDFs

Today, August 06, 2023, I am learning how to work with spreadsheets and PDFs in Python. This may be one of the sleeper most important sections of Jose Portilla's boot camp. It's a short section relative to the other ones. I'm 95% completed with the course and this is the second-to-last section.

This is a good thing. Python is a good thing for me to be learning. Ten years ago, graduating from college with a degree in English, I would not have enjoyed learning this. But Python is thoroughly enjoyable. My pledge to not watch any football this season may aid in my further enjoyment of Python and its application to machine learning.

These coding journals are great, too. They allow me to reflect on what I'm actually doing. As I type this, I am looking at everything I need to achieve my goals. I hava a safe place to live and learn. My coding setup is ideal. My efforts to put my phone down are improving with each passing day. And I feel that if I focus on my de-phoning more, I may be able to do even more enjoyable Python, ML, AI, and data science learning.

Onward.
